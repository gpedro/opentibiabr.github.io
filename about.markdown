Open Tibia Brazil was an organization founded in May 2019, in order to provide a good experience to the Open Tibia community, it is an open organization with open-source projects for the MMORPG server emulator and tools written in C ++, with all useful tutorials.

We made many good evolutions since the creation of this organization, with the help of dozens of contributors, the project grew and became recognized due to this great work provided.
We always try to evolve and innovate more and more so that the project is even more stable and has the least possible failures.
